This just contains the list of Custom Role Abilities that my SCP SL server uses. I'm sharing it with everyone else to use.

This contains all the effects from Joker's Custom Roles plugin as well, including some role specific stuff as their own ability (such as Dwarfs being smaller), you can find [Joker's custom roles plugin here](https://github.com/joker-119/CustomRoles)

This plugin works best with [My own custom roles plugin](https://github.com/SnivyFilms/SnivysCustomRoles)

This plugin assumes you know how to apply abilities by config from roles that may not have them by default
